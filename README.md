# WARNING!
This repo is far from complete. I use it for my own projects and usually only add what I need myself.
Feel free to open an issue or merge request, when you are interested in extending it.

Have a peek here: https://github.com/MrEbbinghaus/Todoish/blob/master/src/main/todoish/models/todo.cljs#L40
Until I want to write a better doc.
